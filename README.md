## Stack My Paddle- Pickleball Community

## Description
Pickleball is one of the fastest growing sports in the world. Anyone from any age can play, however it can be extremely difficult to find games and many of the sites already out there are not very user-friendly. Our website will fill this space, creating a hub for local players to connect and setup games.

## Technology Used
Node, Express, Handlebars, Sequelize, bcrypt, geocoder

## User Story
AS A user
I WANT a website that allows me to find pickleball courts within my area
SO THAT I can easily find games and people with similar interests.

## Usage
Users are able to search for local pickleball courts off the main page. If the user creates an account, they are able to select their rating and favorite courts. This will allow players of similar skill within the area to connect.
